# itunes_json
This uses the [iTunesLibrary framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ituneslibrary) to emit JSON representing the music library.

In Catalina, the iTunes Music Library.xml file no longer exists. My [web generator](https://github.com/bolsinga/web_generator) program relies upon this. This code will use the library to create JSON for web generator to read.
